# Smart-Phone-Controlled-Home-Automation-Using-Arduino

The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth being remotely controlled by any Android OS smart phone.

As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter.
Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches.

## working

The main brain for this project is Arduino Uno board along with Arduino Ethernet shield to give it a wireless connectivity. 

Arduino runs a code to control a relay board according to the input and also serves a web page through which respective output to the relay board can be controlled. Through relay (a relay is an electrically operated switch.) 

Controller board we can control lamps, tubes or any ac power sockets.

You will be able to control all of your ac appliances wirelessly with the help of any device.
